# Molecular Science for Mental Health

## 🔬 About Us

The **Molecular Science for Mental Health** laboratory is dedicated to research at the intersection of molecular biology and mental health. Our goal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to psychiatric disorders, aiming to understand the biological foundations that influence these complex conditions.

## 💡 What We Do

- **Single-Nucleus Research**: We focus on single-nucleus data analysis, utilizing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility analysis (ATAC-seq) of post-mortem samples to identify genetic and epigenetic patterns related to psychiatric disorders.

## ⚙️ Skills and Tools

- **Languages**: R
- **Bioinformatics**: Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis, data pre-processing, and quality control.
- **Research Interests**: Psychiatric disorders.

## 📚 How to Contribute

We welcome students and researchers interested in collaborations or learning more about our research to get in touch.
